###CRAFT BEER TRACKER
###CRUD APPLICATION PROJECT

##OBJECTIVE

To create a CRUD application with the utilisation of supporting tools, methodologies and technologies that encapsulate all core modules covered during training.

The project will involve concepts from all the core training modules; more specifically, this will involve:

*Project Management
*Databases
*Java SE
*Spring Boot
*Front-End Development
*Automated Testing

##PROJECT MANAGEMENT - JIRA

For the project, I used a scrum project on Jira. Once compiling my user stories in my backlog, including story point estimations, I assigned them to three Epics: Database, Back-End, and Front-End. I then created a Sprint, that lasted for 3 days.

During the project, I returned to my Sprint board to update issues to identify them as "In Progress" or "Done" when appropriate. I also linked my GitHub and Jira accounts together, in order to comment on issues when pushing code to GitHub.
